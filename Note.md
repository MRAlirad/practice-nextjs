# NextJS

a framework for building **fast** & **search-engine friendly** applications.

We can do **full-stack** development.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

A technique that allows us to render our component on the server and send their content to the client. This technique makes our application fast and search-engine friendly.

## Static Site Generation

we can pre-render certain pages and components that have static data when we build our application. We just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed.
