# NextJS

a framework for building **fast** & **search-engine friendly** applications.

We can do **full-stack** development.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

A technique that allows us to render our component on the server and send their content to the client. This technique makes our application fast and search-engine friendly.

## Static Site Generation

we can pre-render certain pages and components that have static data when we build our application. We just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed.

## Routing and Navigation

routing in Next.js is baset on the file system. every folder in our app folder must have a file name **page.tsx**

with **Link** component from 'next/link' you can navigate between pages as a SPA
